### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 
    Lab 1 is one of my favorites because it was the first program I wrote. The task was simple, create a hello world program with our names. Seeing the code run and work made me happy and motivated me to learn about programming so I can build more programs.

* Lab 5
    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite becuase it involved doing math with our code. We had to find the area of a rectangle and it was a challenge but worth it. Seeing our code come up with the same answer as us or a calculator made me and my lab partner smile.

* Lab 6
    Lab 6, part 1 was another favorite because it had madlibs. I enjoy madlibs because they can make some funny ideas and making one with code was a great time. My lab partner and I finished this part fast so we spent some time making a lot of sentences with our code.
